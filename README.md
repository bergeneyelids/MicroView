Test Arduino Projects with MicroView

OneWireTemperature
-----------------
A OneWire Temperature sensor connected to Microview shows current, min, max temperature and whether it is increasing or decreasing.
Smoothing is used to get a more accurate temp reading.
A custom uView font (up/down arrows) has been created to show temperature change direction.
